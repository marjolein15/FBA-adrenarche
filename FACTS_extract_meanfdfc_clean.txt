#20. Extract individual mean fd/fc values of significant clusters for plotting
#This example depends on there being a statistically significant effect in a particular pathway, where all significant fixels reside within adjacent voxels 
#(and other unrelated statistically-significant pathways cannot be connected via a chain of adjacent voxels)
# and there are no statistically-significant crossing-fibre fixels within that pathway. 

#-Generate a mask of voxels that contain at least one statistically-significant fixel:
fixel2voxel fwe_pvalue_t#.mif max - | mrthreshold - fwe_voxel_mask.mif -abs 0.95

#-Run a connected-component analysis to select contiguous clusters:
maskfilter fwe_voxel_mask.mif connect fwe_voxel_clusters.mif

#-Using mrview, determine the cluster that corresponds to your pathway of interest. Each cluster will contain an integer value; voxels within the largest cluster will have a value of 1, those within the second-largest cluster will have a value of 2, and so on. 
#Generate a voxel mask corresponding to your pathway of interest: 
#(Replace "^" with the integer value you determined from step 3)
mrcalc fwe_voxel_clusters.mif ^ -eq pathway_voxel_mask.mif -datatype bit

#-Project this voxel pathway mask up to all fixels within the selected voxels: (change directory names to the right folders)
voxel2fixel pathway_voxel_mask.mif inputfixel_directory/ outputfixel_directory/ pathway_fixel_mask.mif

#-Use the combination of a p<0.05 threshold, and your pathway mask, to generate a fixel mask containing only significant fixels within your pathway of interest:
mrcalc fwe_pvalue_t#.mif 0.95 -gt pathway_fixel_mask.mif -mult fwe_pathway_fixel_mask.mif

#-Once you have this fixel mask, getting e.g. the mean FD/FC within the statistically-significant segment of the pathway is easy:
for pp in ${projectdir}/template/difference_log_fc/difference_F*.mif ; do mrstats ${pp} -mask fwe_pathway_fixel_mask.mif -output mean >> pathway_meanfc_pp.txt ; done
